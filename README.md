## Project Overview

# Main tools used for building the project:

- UI building Library: React
- Language: TypeScript

# Styling:

- Implemented with React Inline CSS

## Expected outcomes

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## Not completed tasks

- Mobile view

## Where I stuck / What feedback I would appreciate

- How to reuse inline CSS better?
- Any feedback related to the project's structure.
- I used Context API for managing Dark/Light mode: I will appreciate any feedback around it.
- How to better manager different design for Desktop / Mobile with Inline CSS? Can I use Context API again? Any suggestions here would be great.
  As potential solution I am looking at this library:
  ![react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive)
- Any feedback related to keeping code clean.
