## What I have learned while I was working on this project

1. **Sass** library for keeping my CSS CLEAN and DRY.
2. **Context API** from React for managing global states in application.
3. How to setup from scratch **Storybook**.
4. Practiced more React.
5. Practiced building responsive applications.
6. Practices **mobile first** development approach.
7. **Never** use inline CSS or JavaScript CSS if you need to build a lot of components with the custom design. Librariles like Sass are better for such projects.
